# Nimbyx_test

Using the file, create a simple K-Nearest program in python by getting the closest value based from the following parameters or inputs:

cx = 6.63518038

cy = - 4.37991231

cz = - 0.06342713


The jupyter notebook implements a simple KNN with N number of neighbors selected from the experiment with the least RMSE.
